2. Read the four criteria for Free Software
3. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
   - A license can prevent someone from stealing your work and claiming it as their own.
   - A license can ensure your work is used for the purposes you intended (hopefully not evil)
   - A license can gives you control over if/how other people can modify your work.
4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
   
   - Using a project without an explicit license is risky because you cannot be sure you are within your legal rights to use the software (you can't even know what rights you have)
   
5. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
   - I agree with the claim that Gopher's closed-development hindered its widespread use. The original developers having control over the direction of the project prevented community members (many of whom would have a large incentive to contribute to the software) from contributing. The IETF providing a platform through their Internet Drafts and Requests for Comments ensured that many developers had control over the direction that the WWW would take.
6. Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
    - I don't think that you can infer the intent of software projects by the licenses that they use. It makes sense to me that Microsoft's .NET would use the MIT license because the MIT license doesn't require that any modifications made to the software should also be open source. The .NET core is meant to be a tool for developers to make software, and if all developers using the tool would be required to open-source their creations, the incentive to use the tool to make software would be greatly decreased. Android is a case where I don't think you can infer the purpose of the software from the license it uses. I think that if Google had its way, it would keep all of android closed-source including the kernel, much like Apple does with IOS.



7. As a table, make up an open source project and a ***business model*** that you could use to make money from it.

8.   Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io/projects) or [past RCOS Projects](https://rcos.io/projects/past) and create a table for which project has which license.
   | Project      | License   | 
   | ------------ | --------- | 
   | Organizer    | MIT       | 
   | OpenCircuits | GNU GPLv3 | 
   | 990          | GNU GPLv3 | 
   | DormDesign   | MIT       | 
   | FLOM         | MIT       |
