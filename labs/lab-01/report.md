2. a. If you are asking a technical question, post a replit/codepen of a minimum reproducible example so that people reading your question can debug your code.

   b. Develop relationships and make friends you know in real life because they are far more likely to put up with you asking questions like a "luser" every once in a while.

3. I think that if something like this happened today, it would definitely play out differently, and he could have kept his $12000. I'm pretty sure courts would side with him. I think his situation is analogous to how the bittorrent protocol protected pirates for a long time in the heyday of thepiratebay and KAT (no longer the case) under the logic that these public trackers were not themselves hosting the pirated material and therefore not liable for its distribution. I'm also suprised by the fact that RPI allowed a student to index all the files on the RPI network and expose them to the public. That probably wouldn't fly today. This chapter made me pretty sad that he didn't fight the lawsuit. It also serves as a reminder of the unfortunate role money plays in law and politics.

I made the minute hand of a clock

8. I want to evaluate Rocket.rs, an open source web server written in rust. I also know what project I want to work on; google doesn't accumulate granular menu data in google maps, and Grubhub/Uber-Eats etc. do not currently have a public API. I want to bulid a user-contributed database of menu items. I have already put considerable work into this project and am a few weeks from having a MVP.
